FTS, a Black Metal action game in tradition of The Frogger. FTS was inspired by a mystery Black Metal musician's phrase during a hot summers day at mystery Metal Festival. Your task is to evade the sunshine and reach your unholy, satanic target. Game was developed as part of my Python studies. Development started of along with the online course "Intermediate Python – Learn Pygame by Making a Game" by Nimish Narang and then further developed with the help of ChatGPT. All feedback and further development of the game would be more than welcome.
